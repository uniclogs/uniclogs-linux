# rpi-image-gen image provisioning defaults

# The Provisioning Map defines how the image will be provisioned on the device
# for which it's intended. The pmap is an extension of the Image Description
# JSON file generated by the build. Providing a pmap is optional, but it is
# mandatory for provisioning using Raspberry Pi tools.
#
# If set to a non-empty string, an image layout must provide file
# provisionmap-<$pmap>.json in it's device directory.
